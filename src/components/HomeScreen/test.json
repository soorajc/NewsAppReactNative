     "content" : "He joined a Republican administration last month that's often accused of downplaying or disregarding science, but the new surgeon general says hes nonpartisan and will let science and data drive his approach to the opioid epidemic.It's more important than ever to have that objective voice, physician Jerome Adams said his first sit-down interview since taking office. Everyones got their own opinion (but) make no mistake, the science does matter.Adams says his first “Surgeon General’s Report” will be on health and the economy, due in large part to the importance of jobs for people in recovery and because addiction is the main impediment to solving unemployment in many states.After President Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency on Thursday, Adams issued a statement underscoring his passion for partnerships that include employers: 'We must ... fully leverage all of our public health, business, law enforcement, and community resources to address these issues head on,' he said.The epidemic's economic connection is embraced by even Virginia's Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe. He said at a panel discussion that included Adams recently that employers tell him up to seven out of 10 of job candidates in his state can't pass the drug test.In Indiana, where Adams was health commissioner under then-Gov. Mike Pence, the state had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country but employers would often say 'we can't find enough healthy employees he says."
