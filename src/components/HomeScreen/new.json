In August, Trump warned the North not to make any more threats against the United States, and said that if it did, it would be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.Song said at the news conference that he and Mattis agreed to further cooperation on strengthening Seouls defense capabilities, including lifting warhead payload limits on South Korean conventional missiles and supporting the country acquisition of most advanced military assets. He offered no specifics and refused to answer when asked whether the discussions included nuclear-powered submarines. Some South Korean government officials have endorsed the nation getting nuclear-powered submarines amid calls for more military strength. Theres a growing concern among the South Korean public that North Koreas expanding nuclear weapons arsenal, which may soon include an intercontinental ballistic missile that could target the U.S. mainland, would undermine Seouls long alliance with Washington."
